Footnote(s): Data for 2023 and 2024 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of preliminary data in trend assessments is discouraged. Numbers less than 12͵ and rates and percentages based on these numbers͵ should be interpreted with caution. HIV diagnoses and PrEP data for the year 2020͵ which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic͵ should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the pandemic on access to HIV testing͵ PrEP prescriptions͵ and care-related services. Data by transmission category presented based on sex assigned at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.
   Death data for the year 2022 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2023. Deaths in 2020 and beyond should be interpreted considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information͵ see <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>. Death data based on residence at death. See Technical Notes for death reporting by jurisdiction.
   Prevalence data for the year 2022 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2023. Prevalence data prior to 2010 are based on residence at diagnosis; prevalence data from 2010 to present are based on most recent known address. See Technical Notes for death reporting by jurisdiction.
   Linkage to care is based on cases diagnosed during the year queried.
   Receipt of care is based on persons living with diagnosed HIV at the end of the year queried.PrEP coverage͵ reported as a percentage͵ is calculated as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP divided by the estimated number of persons aged ≥16 years who had indications for PrEP. To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators͵ data are presented for ≥13‒ and 13‒24-year-olds͵ but represent ≥16‒ and 16‒24-years-olds͵ respectively. CDC has paused PrEP coverage reporting to determine the best methodology for calculating PrEP coverage͵ and to update PrEP coverage estimates using updated methods and sources. Until updated PrEP coverage estimates are published͵ CDC advises against citing specific PrEP coverage data points͵ as historical estimates will be updated.
   Weighted percentages for unstable housing or homelessness and median HIV stigma scores are reported in the ‘Rate per 100͵000’ column with corresponding 95% confidence intervals reported in the ‘Rate LCI’ and ‘Rate UCI’ columns within the Charts and Maps tools or in parentheses within the ‘Rate per 100͵000’ column within the Tables tool.
   To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators͵ data are presented for persons aged ≥13 years and aged 13-24 years. However͵ these estimates are representative of persons with diagnosed HIV aged ≥18 years and 18-24 years͵ respectively. 
   For unstable housing or homelessness͵ estimates with a coefficient of variation ≥0.30 or those based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed. For HIV stigma͵ estimates based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed.
   See Technical Notes for more details on data availability͵ stratifications͵ and variable definitions.
   * Estimates with an absolute CI width ≥30͵ estimates with an absolute CI width between 5 and 30 and a relative CI width greater than 130%͵ and estimates of 0% or 100% should be interpreted with caution.
   ^ Jurisdiction with incomplete reporting of deaths for most recent year.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex assigned at birth or gender identity.
   NA - Not applicable.
